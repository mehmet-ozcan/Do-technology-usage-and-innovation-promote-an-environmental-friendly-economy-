## üìò About the Study  

Rapid economic expansion across Asia has exacerbated environmental challenges, raising concerns about balancing growth with sustainability. This study investigates how **technology usage** and **innovation** influence both **economic efficiency** and **environmental performance** in 30 Asian economies.  

The research employs **Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)** to compute efficiency scores and integrates them into an **Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC)** model.  

**Key findings include:**  
- Technological advancements enhance **economic efficiency** immediately.  
- Their **environmental benefits** emerge only after surpassing a threshold of **~14,900 USD per capita**.  
- Achieving high economic efficiency alone does not ensure sustainability unless innovation strategies are aligned with **green growth policies**.  

This study contributes to sustainable development debates by providing **empirical evidence** that innovation-driven strategies are essential for reconciling economic expansion with environmental protection.
